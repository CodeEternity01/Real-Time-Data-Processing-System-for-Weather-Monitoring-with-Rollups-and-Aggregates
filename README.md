## Overview
This application monitors real-time weather conditions using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It retrieves weather data every few minutes for the major metros in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad), processes the information, and provides daily summaries. Additionally, it triggers alerts based on user-defined thresholds, such as high temperatures or specific weather conditions.

## Features
1. **Real-Time Data Retrieval**: Retrieves weather data every 5 minutes.
2. **Daily Weather Summaries**:
   - Average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.
   - Dominant weather condition (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear).
3. **User-Configurable Alerting**:
   - Set temperature or weather condition thresholds.
   - Alerting via console or email notification.
4. **Visualizations**: Daily summaries, historical trends, and alerts.

#Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
API Key Setup:

Sign up on OpenWeatherMap and obtain a free API key.
Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> in the code with your API key.
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
Configuration
The interval for data retrieval can be configured in the application settings (default: 5 minutes).
User-defined thresholds for alerts can be set to customize notifications for weather conditions like temperature limits or specific conditions (e.g., heatwave alerts).
Usage
Upon launch, the application retrieves weather data every 5 minutes.
Summaries: At the end of each day, a summary is stored containing:
Average temperature
Maximum and minimum temperatures
Dominant weather condition
Alerts: Alerts trigger if thresholds are breached, with real-time notifications on the console or via email (optional).
Rollups and Aggregates
Daily Weather Summary:
Aggregates daily data to provide:
Average Temperature
Maximum and Minimum Temperatures
Dominant Weather Condition based on most frequent occurrences.
Alerting Thresholds:
Configure temperature or condition thresholds (e.g., alert if temperature >35Â°C for two consecutive updates).
Alerts triggered if conditions are met, with messages displayed in-app.
Visualizations
The application includes visualizations for:

Daily Summaries: Displays weather trends over the course of the day.
Historical Trends: Track historical data on average temperatures and weather patterns.
Alerts: Shows a log of all triggered alerts.
Testing
System Setup:
Verify system starts successfully and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API with a valid API key.
Data Retrieval:
Simulate API calls at the defined interval and confirm data retrieval for each city.
Ensure response parsing correctly interprets each weather parameter.
Temperature Conversion:
Confirm temperatures convert from Kelvin to Celsius accurately.
Alert Thresholds:
Simulate data exceeding thresholds to ensure alerts trigger as expected.
